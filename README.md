# ISLR: An Introduction to Statistical Learning

In this repository, I store some of the codes I have written through my study of the book ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). They include labs and solution to exercises.   
The *easiest* way to view the labs or solutions is to preview the PDF files associated with each chapter. However, the *best* way to view them is in HTML format, which allows for additional features (such as floating table of contents which facilitates file navigation, or use of tabs which helps with visual comparison of similar results). The drawback is that, unlike PDF, these HTML files cannot be previewed in GitHub. They could be viewed after downloading the files and corresponding folders.  
A more comprehensive overview of different formats can be seen below:


1. *PDF documents*
The PDF documents contain the codes, the results and explanation. In GitHub, scrolling through the PDF files might be slow. To scroll faster, the files could be downloaded. Alternatively, one may scroll through the Rmarkdown Notebook files (described below) on GitHub, with the drawback that  they exclude the rendered codes.  

2. *Rmarkdown Notebook files, with the extension \*.Rmd*:  
Such a notebook includes the code and corresponding explanation. This file should be downloaded and rendered within RStudio to create different output formats, such as HTML or PDF. After rendering, one can see the code and results in the same document.    
    * Github may not show the Rmarkdown syntax properly, for example when there are Latex codes. For proper formatting, the file should be viewed in RStudio.  
    
3. *The HTML document resulted from rendering the Rmarkdown Notebook*:  
Such a document includes the codes, explanation and results. Previews are typically not available in Github, due to large size, and if available they are not rendered (i.e. the source HTML code would be previewed). To access the files, the HTML and its related files could be downloaded.

4. *The NB.HTML document resulted from rendering the Rmarkdown Notebook*:  
A self-contained HTML file, which could be viewed in a browser if downloaded. The GitHub preview only shows the source HTML code.
