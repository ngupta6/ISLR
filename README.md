# ISLR

In this repository, I store some of the codes I have written through my study of the book ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). They include labs and solution to exercises, all done with R.  
The information can be accessed through two formats:  

1. Rmarkdown Notebook files, with the extension \*.Rmd:  
Such a notebook includes the code and related explanation. This file should be downloaded and rendered to create an HTML file from within RStudio. After rendering, one can see the code and results within the same document.    
    * Github may not show the Rmarkdown syntax properly, for example when there are Latex codes. For proper formatting, the file should be viewed in RStudio.  
2. The HTML document resulted from rendering the Rmarkdown Notebook:  
Such a document includes the codes, explanation and results. Previews are not available in Github, due to large size. Therefore, an HTML and its related files, or an entire folder, could be downloaded to access the files.
