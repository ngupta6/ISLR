# ISLR: An Introduction to Statistical Learning

In this repository, I store some of the codes I have written through my study of the book ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). They include labs and solution to exercises.   
The information can be accessed through three formats:  

1. *PDF documents*
The PDF documents contain the codes, the results and explanation. In GitHub, scrolling through the PDF files might be slow. To scroll faster, the files could be downloaded. Alternatively, one may scroll through the Rmarkdown Notebook (described below) on GitHub, but could *not* see the rendered code.  

2. *Rmarkdown Notebook files, with the extension \*.Rmd*:  
Such a notebook includes the code and corresponding explanation. This file should be downloaded and rendered within RStudio to create different output formats, such as HTML or PDF. After rendering, one can see the code and results in the same document.    
    * Github may not show the Rmarkdown syntax properly, for example when there are Latex codes. For proper formatting, the file should be viewed in RStudio.  
    
3. *The NB.HTML document resulted from rendering the Rmarkdown Notebook*:  
A self-contained HTML file, which could be viewed in a browser if downloaded. The GitHub preview only shows the source HTML code.
